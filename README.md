# Triggers

Problem Statement:
This project involves designing SQL triggers to automate essential database operations, such as data backup and record maintenance, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

Technical Methods Used:

Trigger Implementation:
Automated backup of deleted records from the main table (Student_details) to a backup table (Student_details_backup).

Benefits:
1. Eliminated manual intervention in critical processes.
2. Enhanced data reliability and minimized risks of data loss.

Key Code Highlights:
1. Trigger Logic: Captures deleted entries and automatically inserts them into the backup table.
2. Use Case: Designed for educational purposes, this trigger can be extended to enterprise use cases where data preservation is critical.
